<Callout type="info" title="New in v1.1">
JEngine ships with a Claude Code plugin that provides AI-assisted development skills for building hot-updatable games.
</Callout>

## Overview

The JEngine Claude Code plugin is a `.claude-plugin/` directory in the JEngine repository that provides specialized skills for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). These skills teach Claude how to write idiomatic JEngine code — zero-GC patterns, proper object pooling, MessageBox usage, editor UI components, and more.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed
- JEngine v1.1 project set up

### Install from Marketplace

```bash
# Add JEngine marketplace (one-time)
claude plugin marketplace add JasonXuDeveloper/JEngine

# Install plugin
claude plugin install jengine@jengine-marketplace
```

### Enable Auto-Updates (Recommended)

Third-party plugins require manual opt-in for auto-updates:

1. Run `/plugin` in Claude Code
2. Go to **Marketplaces** tab
3. Select **jengine-marketplace**
4. Toggle **Enable auto-update**

Once enabled, the plugin updates automatically when Claude Code starts.

### Manual Setup

The `.claude-plugin/` directory is included in the JEngine repo. If you cloned JEngine, the skills are already available — Claude Code detects them automatically.

## Available Skills

### JEngine.Util (Runtime)

| Skill | Command | What It Covers |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **JAction** | `/jaction` | Chainable actions, zero-allocation patterns, parallel execution |
| **JObjectPool** | `/jobjectpool` | Thread-safe object pooling with proper lifecycle management |
| **Game Patterns** | `/game-patterns` | Zero-GC game patterns — spawners, cooldowns, combat systems, DoT, health regen |

### JEngine.UI (Runtime + Editor)

| Skill | Command | What It Covers |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **MessageBox** | `/messagebox` | Async modal dialogs with pooling |
| **Editor UI** | `/editor-ui` | Building editor tools with JEngine UI components (JButton, JStack, Tokens, etc.) |

## Workflow

<Steps>
<Step>
### Describe What You Want
Tell Claude what gameplay feature or editor tool you need in plain language.
</Step>

<Step>
### Review Generated Code
Claude produces JEngine-idiomatic code using the correct packages, namespaces, and patterns.
</Step>

<Step>
### Build and Push
Compile the hot-update assembly and push to players — no rebuild required.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Example

```
You: "Create a retry system that attempts to connect to the server
      every 2 seconds, with a 30-second timeout"

Claude generates a JAction-based solution using:
- Static lambdas for zero allocation
- RepeatUntil with proper timeout
- OnCancel for failure handling
- using pattern for auto-dispose
```
