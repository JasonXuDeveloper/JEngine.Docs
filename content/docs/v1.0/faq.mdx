This page collects frequently asked questions and solutions when using JEngine v1.0.

## Installation and Configuration

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What are the Unity version requirements?">
JEngine v1.0 requires Unity 2022.3 or higher. Unity 2022.3 LTS is recommended for best stability.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="HybridCLR installation failed?">
1. Ensure Unity version meets requirements
2. Check network connection (may need VPN)
3. Manually clean `HybridCLRData` directory and reinstall
4. Check [HybridCLR Common Errors](https://www.hybridclr.cn/docs/help/commonerrors)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Errors when first opening the project?">
- Check if extraction is complete (incomplete extraction may cause missing files)
- Confirm Unity version meets requirements
- Try deleting the `Library` directory and reopening the project
- Check if antivirus software deleted DLL files
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Hot Update Code

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Hot update code cannot access main project code?">
Hot update code can only access:
- Code in Packages
- Code in Plugins
- Existing DLL files
- Assemblies defined with asmdef

Main project (Assembly-CSharp) code requires:
1. Create asmdef file to separate into independent assembly
2. Add reference in `HotUpdate/Code/HotUpdate.Code.asmdef`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hot update code compilation failed?">
Common causes:
- **Syntax errors**: Check for compilation errors in hot update code
- **Reference errors**: Ensure all referenced libraries are properly configured
- **HybridCLR not installed**: Install HybridCLR first
- **Obfuz or HybridCLR issues**: Check corresponding documentation
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cannot debug after code obfuscation?">
- Disable obfuscation in Obfuz configuration during development
- Use [Stack Trace Deobfuscation Tool](https://www.obfuz.com/docs/manual/deobfuscate-stacktrace)
- Keep obfuscation mapping files for debugging
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Resource Management

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Resource loading failed?">
Check the following:
1. Is the resource path correct (needs full path)?
2. Is the resource in YooAsset configuration?
3. Is the package configuration correct?
4. Was the resource successfully packaged?
5. Is the package properly loaded?
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to add new resource directories?">
1. Create directory under `HotUpdate/`
2. Open `YooAsset/AssetBundle Collector`
3. Add collection rules for new directory (refer to YooAsset documentation)
4. Repackage resources
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Resource download is slow?">
- Use CDN acceleration
- Enable resource compression
- Properly divide resource package sizes
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Packaging and Publishing

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Build package failed?">
First, check the Unity Editor's **Console** window for **error messages** (not info or warning).

Common solutions:
1. **Missing Scriptable Build Pipeline**: Ensure `Packages/manifest.json` contains exactly this version:
   ```json
   "com.unity.scriptablebuildpipeline": "1.21.25"
   ```
   The version **must be 1.21.25**. See [YooAsset FAQ](https://www.yooasset.com/docs/FAQ) for details.

2. **Missing IL2CPP**: If building for a platform that requires IL2CPP (iOS, Android, etc.), install the IL2CPP module for that platform via Unity Hub, then **restart Unity Editor**.

3. **Other errors**: Search the error message in [YooAsset FAQ](https://www.yooasset.com/docs/FAQ) or [HybridCLR Common Errors](https://www.hybridclr.cn/docs/help/commonerrors).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Packaging failed with encryption error?">
- Check if encryption key configuration is correct
- Ensure key length meets requirements (16/32 bits)
- Check configuration files in `Resources/EncryptConfigs/`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="WebGL platform packaging failed?">
- Check if Unity WebGL module is installed
- Ensure no unsupported APIs are used
- Check if memory settings are reasonable
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Mini-game platform limitations?">
Different platforms have different limitations:
| Platform | First Package | Total |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| WeChat Mini Game | ≤4MB | ≤20MB |
| ByteDance Mini Game | ≤4MB | - |
| Alipay Mini Game | ≤5MB | - |

Recommend using sub-packages and CDN.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Runtime Errors

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Button/UI/Timeline events not working?">
Unity doesn't support adding hot update type functions to events in the editor. You need to register events manually in code.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Version mismatch error?">
- Clear local cache: `yoo` directory
- Ensure server resources are up to date
- Check if version configuration is correct
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hot update manifest or resources cannot load?">
- Check if decryption method matches encryption method
- Check if decryption key is configured correctly
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hot update scene cannot load?">
- Confirm scene is in Build Settings
- Check if scene is in hot update resource package
- Verify scene name is correct (case-sensitive)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MessageBox not showing?">
- Check if MessageBox prefab exists
- Confirm related resources exist in Resources directory
- Check if other UI is blocking
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hot update code execution error?">
- Check HybridCLR or Obfuz documentation based on logs
- If it is reflection code, [refer to this](https://www.obfuz.com/docs/manual/reflection)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do typeof(Type).Name or nameof(member) cause errors on device?">
This happens when you use the string from `typeof(Type).Name` or `nameof(member)` for loading hot-update resources by path. JEngine uses Obfuz to obfuscate hot-update code, which changes class and member names.

**Solutions:**
1. Get the real name by following the [Obfuz reflection documentation](https://www.obfuz.com/docs/manual/reflection)
2. Use `ObfuzIgnoreAttribute` to prevent obfuscation of specific names ([docs](https://www.obfuz.com/docs/manual/customattributes))

<Callout type="info">
We recommend using `ObfuzIgnoreAttribute` (Solution 2) as it is more convenient and flexible.
</Callout>
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## JEngine.Util Package

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="How do I install the JEngine.Util package?">
<Tabs items={['OpenUPM CLI', 'Unity Package Manager']}>
<Tab value="OpenUPM CLI">
```bash
openupm add com.jasonxudeveloper.jengine.util
```
</Tab>
<Tab value="Unity Package Manager">
Visit the [OpenUPM page](https://openupm.com/packages/com.jasonxudeveloper.jengine.util/) for manual installation steps.
</Tab>
</Tabs>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between JAction state overloads and closures?">
State overloads avoid heap allocation by passing state as a parameter:

```csharp
// Closure (allocates)
player => player.TakeDamage(10)

// State overload (zero allocation)
static (p) => p.TakeDamage(10), player
```

<Callout type="warn">
State overloads only work with **reference types** (classes). For value types (int, float, struct), use closures.
</Callout>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between JObjectPool and Unity's ObjectPool?">
JObjectPool uses lock-free CAS operations for better performance in high-frequency scenarios. It also provides built-in shared pools per type via `JObjectPool.Shared<T>()`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When should I use JAction vs coroutines?">
JAction provides:
- Chainable fluent API for better readability
- Zero-GC async execution with `ExecuteAsync()`
- Built-in object pooling
- State overloads for performance-critical code

Use coroutines for simple delays; use JAction for complex sequences or when GC matters.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Performance Optimization

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Game startup is slow?">
- Reduce first package resource size
- Use asynchronous loading
- Optimize initial scene
- Pre-download common resources
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="High memory usage?">
- Promptly unload unused resource packages
- Use object pool management
- Regularly clean cache
- Optimize texture sizes
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Poor hot update code performance?">
v1.0 uses HybridCLR with greatly improved performance:
- Value type calculations improved up to 10x
- Use profiling tools to locate bottlenecks
- Check if it's your own issue (e.g., frequent memory allocation causing GC)
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Development Tips

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="How to debug quickly?">
- Use Editor Dev Mode to skip packaging
- Enable IngameDebugConsole to view logs
- Use conditional compilation to distinguish environments
- Keep detailed log output
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to handle platform differences?">
```csharp
#if UNITY_EDITOR
    // Editor code
#elif UNITY_ANDROID
    // Android platform code
#elif UNITY_IOS
    // iOS platform code
#endif
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Problems after update?">
Emergency handling process:
1. Immediately rollback server resources
2. Notify users to clear cache
3. Republish after fixing issues
4. Consider forced update mechanism
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Best Practices
